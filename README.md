# ShakespeareLSTM

This was the final project for my Advanced Machine Learning methods class at UCSD.  It uses an LSTM architechture to investigate how viable different character encoding schemes are for producing coherent sentences when trained on the TinyShakespeare dataset.  Please read more in the "COGS 185 Final Project write-up".
